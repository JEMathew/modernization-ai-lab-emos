# Codex Engineering Instructions

## Mission

Build the smallest reliable Track 3 demo for Modernization AI Lab.

## Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- SQLite
- Pydantic
- OpenAI Python SDK
- Pytest

Do not introduce React, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud databases unless
the existing application requires them.

## Product rules

- This is an AI agency, not a chatbot.
- All enterprise data is synthetic.
- Numeric scores must be calculated by Python.
- LLMs explain results but do not invent numeric scores.
- Every assessment run must create stored artifacts.
- High-risk decisions require human approval.
- The app must work without an OpenAI call by using a deterministic fallback.
- Preserve a working happy path after every change.
- Add tests for scoring, 6R, prioritization, and replanning.
- Do not expose API keys.
- Do not implement features outside the current work packet.

## MVP scenario

Apex Aerospace Manufacturing has multiple legacy platforms. The app must
select the Oracle Customer Analytics Warehouse and generate an
Oracle-to-BigQuery implementation-ready starter package.

## Definition of done

A packet is done only when:

1. The app starts.
2. Required tests pass.
3. The feature is visible in the UI.
4. Generated output is stored.
5. Error states are handled.
6. Existing features still work.

## Completion report

After each packet, create a report in work_results containing:

- files changed
- commands run
- tests run
- test results
- acceptance criteria met
- known issues
- demo steps

## Permanent engineering workspace

Before starting an approved work packet, read
`docs/engineering/README.md` and the authorities it routes to. Use the official
slice and release identifiers in `docs/backlog/VERTICAL_SLICE_REGISTRY.md` and
`docs/releases/RELEASE_REGISTRY.md`. A registry entry records planning state; it
does not authorize implementation.

Every implementation packet must define its objective, acceptance criteria,
dependencies, exclusions, validation, and completion report before scope is
expanded. Architecture decisions that meet an ADR trigger use the template in
`docs/adr/0000-template.md`.
